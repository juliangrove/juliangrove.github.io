* About
  I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher in the [[http://factslab.io/][FACTS.lab]], directed by [[http://aaronstevenwhite.io/][Aaron
  Steven White]], at the [[https://www.rochester.edu/][University of Rochester]]. Previously, I was affiliated
  with the [[https://gu-clasp.github.io/][Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability]] at the
  [[https://www.gu.se/en][University of Gothenburg]]. I am generally interested in type-theoretic
  approaches to natural language semantics, which I am to connect with the
  computational (Bayesian) modeling of human behavior. I aim to do this in a way
  that preserves the tools, like Î»-calculus, that semanticists are typically
  used to.

  My recent work has also focused on on the semantics of presupposition and
  anaphora, and I've been investigating approaches to presupposition triggers
  that view them as scope-taking devices. I've also done experimental work
  focusing on ellipsis, and I was affiliated with the University of Chicago's
  [[http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/][Language Processing Lab]].

  You can email me at firstname.lastname@{gmail.com, rochester.edu}.
