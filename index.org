* About
  I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [[https://gu-clasp.github.io/][Centre for Linguistic Theory
  and Studies in Probability]] at the [[https://www.gu.se][University of Gothenburg]]. I'm interested in
  type-theoretic approaches to semantics; my current research is mainly in the
  semantics of presupposition and anaphora. I have also done experimental work,
  with a focus on ellipsis, and was affiliated with the University of Chicago's
  [[http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/][Language Processing Lab]]. Recently, I've been investigating approaches to
  presupposition triggers that view them as scope-taking devices.
