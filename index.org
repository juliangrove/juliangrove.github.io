* About
  I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [[https://gu-clasp.github.io/][Centre for Linguistic Theory
  and Studies in Probability]] at the [[https://www.gu.se][University of Gothenburg]]. I am generally
  interested in type-theoretic approaches to natural language semantics, which
  I've recently investigated with two research goals in mind:
  - First, to help make theories of dynamic semantics more composable and
    extensible. I've recently tried this using algebraic effects.
  - Second, to connect type-theoretic semantics with the computational modeling
    of human behavior, as in, e.g., RSA models. I aim to do this in a way that
    preserves the tools, like Î»-calculus, that semanticists are typically used
    to.
  Much of my current research is in the semantics of presupposition and
  anaphora. I have also done experimental work, with a focus on ellipsis, and
  was affiliated with the University of Chicago's [[http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/][Language Processing Lab]].
  Recently, I've been investigating approaches to presupposition triggers that
  view them as scope-taking devices.
