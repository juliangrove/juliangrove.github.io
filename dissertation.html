<p>Abstract: I argue that presupposition projection and filtering are best
understood as arising from certain expressions taking scope over expressions
that contain them. According to Barker (2015), an expression takes scope over
another containing it “when the larger [(containing)] expression serves as the
smaller [(contained)] phrase’s semantic argument.” Specifically, it is argued
that presupposition projection occurs when a presupposition trigger takes
scope over the larger phrase containing it, while presupposition filtering
occurs when a presupposition trigger fails to take scope over the larger
phrase containing it. Building on the satisfaction account of presupposition
put forward by Karttunen (1973) and Heim (1983), this perspective on
presupposition is couched within the theory of graded monads, which have
recently been proposed, in functional programming languages such as Haskell,
as a means to structure the composition of functions and arguments which incur
side effects. According to this perspective, presupposition projection is
regarded as a side effect of the composition of at-issue meaning. A
presupposition trigger is then regarded as taking scope when it incurs side
effects. The graded monadic perspective is applied to a general dynamic
semantic account of presupposition and anaphora. Specific topics treated
include presupposition projection in conditionals, the complements of
propositional attitude verbs, and the scopes of indefinites and distributive
quantifiers, like every, as well as null complement anaphora and verb phrase
ellipsis. The perspective is shown to offer natural accounts that make good
linguistic predictions in each case. One particular advantage of the graded
monadic perspective is that, despite coinciding with a satisfaction account of
presupposition projection, it is unsusceptible to the “proviso problem”, which
has been thought to present a problem for satisfaction accounts for at least
the last two decades. Ultimately, what is offered is a comprehensive, yet
simple and modular approach to presupposition in natural language.</p>
