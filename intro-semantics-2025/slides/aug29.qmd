## Distinguishing types of act

@austin_how_1962 classified speech acts at distinct levels.

- Locutionary act:
  an act of uttering a particular expression.
  - e.g., interrogative vs. imperative vs. declarative
- Illocutionary act:
  an an act of uttering something with a particular intended discourse effect.
  - e.g., question vs. comamand vs. assertion
- Perlocutionary effects:
  the worldly effects an utterance actually has.
  - e.g., question answered, command fulfilled, assertion believed

---

## Illocutionary uptake

An illocutionary act may be successful or unsuccessful.

- Successful if it has the intended social consequence (it has uptake).
- Unsuccessful if it does not have this consequence (it does not have uptake).

---

## Uptakes for different acts

(@ex-bet-uptake) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- the bet is *accepted*
	
(@ex-command-uptake) Open the window!
	- addressee accepts the obligation to act
	
(@ex-question-uptake) What time is it?
	- addressee accepts the obligation to answer

(@ex-assertion-uptake) It's 1:20pm.
	- addressee accepts (in some sense) the truth of the sentence

---

## Assertions

@stalnaker_assertion_1978 introduces the notion of the *common ground*.

- set of propositions

::: {.fragment}
Uptake of an assertion:

- addressee accepts the meaning of the sentence into the common ground.
:::

---

## Force and content

Illocutionary acts can be characterized along at least two dimensions:

- illocutionary force:
  what kind of intended social effect is involved?
  - assertoric force, imperative force, interrogative force
- content:
  utterance-specific aspects of conveyed meaning
  - assertions:
	sets of possible worlds ("truth conditions")
  - commands:
	<span class="fragment">"satisfaction conditions"</span>
  - questions:
	<span class="fragment">"answerhood conditions"</span>

---

## Question about content

Where in the taxonomy of acts does content fall?

- Just the illocutionary act?
- Also locutionary effect?
- (Also perlocutionary effect?)

---

## Performatives

(@ex-command-beans-declarative) I [command]{.underline} you to help me cook the beans!

(@ex-titanic) I hereby [name]{.underline} this ship the R.M.S. Titanic!
	- locutionary act: declarative sentence
	- illocutionary act: naming
	- uptake: ship's name is now 'R.M.S. Titanic'

(@ex-marriage) I [promise]{.underline} to stop moving furniture while you're sleeping.
	- locutionary act: declarative sentence
	- illocutionary act: promise
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">promise accepted, obligation registered</span>

---

## Peformatives (cont'd)

(@ex-apology) I [apologize]{.underline}.
	- apology
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">apology accepted</span>

(@ex-marriage) I do.
	- illocutionary act: vow
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">obligation registered</span>
	
(@ex-bet) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- illocutionary act: bet
	- uptake: bet accepted

## Felicity conditions

You can't just perform any speech act haphazardly.

![](images/boat_names.jpg){fig-align="center"}

---

## Felicity conditions

(@ex-apology) I apologize.
	- The speaker should have done something that requires an apology.
	
(@ex-marriage) I do.
	- There should be a vow at stake ("...till death do us part?").
	
(@ex-command) Open the window!
	- The utterer should have the relevant authority.


(@ex-bet) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- The utterer should have the means to procure $300.

---

## Felicity conditions

In general:

- It must be allowable, by convention, for the speech act to have the illocutionary effect that it is intended to have.
- The circumstances prior to the act have to be appropriate.

---

## Performatives redux

Question 1

- What do performatives and other speech acts have in common?

::: {.fragment}
Question 2

- How does illocutionary effect fit into the distinction of @grice_meaning_1957 between meaning$_{NN}$ and meaning$_{N}$?
