# Issues from last time

## Issue: how to evaluate the maxims?

Quantity:
give the right amount of information.

- How much is enough/too much?

::: {.fragment}
Relation:
be relevant.

- Relevant to what?
:::

---

## Questions under discussion

Asking a question:
add the question onto an ongoing record of questions that need to be answered.

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Discourse---at least involving assertions---always has the goal of answering some question [@roberts_information_2012].

- There is always a Question Under Discussion (QUD).
:::

---

## An implicit QUD

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-relation) **Context**: Jo and Bo are outside Pascal's, looking in the window. <br> 
	**Jo**: No one's at the cash register. <br>
	**Bo**: The lights are on.
:::

::: {.fragment}
QUD?

- Is Pascal's open?
:::

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/pascals.jpg){width="300px" height="400px"}
:::

::::

---

## Does this help with evaluating the maxims?

::: {.fragment}
Relation:

- Help resolve the QUD.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Quantity (Part 1):

- Resolve it as much as possible.
:::

---

## On the right track?

(@ex-quantity-qud) **Jo**: How many cookies did Mary eat? <br>
	**Bo**: Mary ate some of the cookies.
	
::: {.fragment}
::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-no-quantity-qud) **Jo**: Is there any evidence against them? <br>
	**Bo**: Some of their identity documents are forgeries.
:::
	
(Based on example from @levinson_presumptive_2000.)
:::

## Issue: the symmetry problem

(@ex-quantity) Jo did some of the readings.
- **Quantity implicature**: Jo didn't do all of the readings.
- **But why not**: Jo did all of the readings?

::: {.fragment}
What we need:
some notion of "possible alternative utterance".
:::

---

## A possibility

What if certain lexical items come with *scales* [@horn_semantic_1972]?

- none < some < all, every
- one < two < three
- decent < great < fantastic!

::: {.fragment}
How might this help with the symmetry problem?
:::

## Summary

- **Speech acts**:
  utterances that use a particular locution with a conventional meaning to achieve a certain social effect.
- **Conversational implicatures**:
  inferences tied to particular speech acts, based on:
  - general principles of rational, cooperative communication [@grice_logic_1975];
  - [conventional meanings]{.gb-blue}.

---

## Where do we go next?

::: {.fragment}
→ conventional meaning
:::

<br>

- First, we need to develop methods for observing and classifying inference types.
- Then, we can focus on the conventional stuff:
  - study how it is encoded in linguistic expressions.

## Defining inference

What is an inference?

- A relation between expressions of a language.
  - $E_{1} ↝ E_{2}$
	- Typically, $E_{2}$ is a declarative sentence.

(@ex-quantity) Jo did some of the readings. <br>
	↝ Jo didn't do all of the readings.
	
(@ex-definite) Could you bring the dog inside? <br>
	↝ There is a dog.

## Data collection

Where do inferences come from?

- Speakers of the language!
  - Your friends.
  - Laboratory experiments.
  - Large crowd-sourced inference judgment studies.

## This class

[Semantics]{.gb-blue} is the study of conventional meaning in natural language.

- Goal:
  give a ridiculously precise account of the inferences that linguistic expressions trigger.
- If we can do this, then we have captured what these expressions *mean*$_{NN}$.

## A taxonomy of inference types

::: {.fragment}
Some types of inference observable in natural language:

- entailment
- conversational implicature
- presupposition
- conventional implicature
:::

---

## Entailment

- A relationship between declarative sentences.
- If $S_{1}$ entails $S_{2}$, then whenever $S_{1}$ is true, $S_{2}$ *must* be true.
  (@ex-at-least) Jo has at least three siblings. <br>
	  ↝ Jo has at least two siblings.
- Entailments are **non-defeasible**.
	  
---

## Non-defeasibility of entailments

(@ex-at-least-contd) \#Jo has at least three siblings, {and, but} she doesn't have at least two siblings.

---

## Conversational implicature

- Typically a relationship between utterances of declarative sentences.
- If an utterance of $S_{1}$ *conversationally implicates* $S_{2}$, then the utterance *means*$_{NN}$ $S_{2}$.
- Conversational implicatures are **defeasible**.

---

## Defeasibility of conversational implicatures

(@ex-quantity-canceled) Jo did some of the readings. In fact, she did all of them.

---

## Presupposition

- A relationship between an expression and a declarative sentence.
- If $E$ presupposes $S$, then whenever an utterance of $E$ is felicitous, $S$ is true.
  (@ex-stop) Jo stopped smoking. <br>
	  ↝ Jo used to smoke.
- Presuppositions are **non-defeasible**.

---

## Non-defeasibility of presuppositions

(@ex-stop-contd) \#Jo stopped smoking, {and, but} she didn't used to smoke.

---

## Summary

|                 | entailment | conv. impl. | presupposition   |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **between**     | sentences  | utterances  | expr. + sentence |
| **defeasible?** | no         | yes         | no               |
