# The symmetry problem

## Example from last time

(@ex-quantity) Jo did some of the readings.
- **Quantity implicature**: Jo didn't do all of the readings.
- But why not: Jo didn't do *only* some of the readings?

::: {.fragment}
What we need:
some notion of "possible alternative".

## Questions under discussion

Asking a question:
add the question onto an ongoing record of questions that need to be answered.

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Discourse---at least involving assertions---always has the goal of answering some question [@roberts_information_2012].

- There is always a Question Under Discussion (QUD).
:::

## Example from last class

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-relation) **Context**: Jo and Bo are outside Pascal's, looking in the window. <br> 
	**Jo**: No one's at the cash register. <br>
	**Bo**: The lights are on.
:::

::: {.fragment}
QUD?

- Is Pascal's open?
:::

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/pascals.jpg){width="300px" height="400px"}
:::

::::

## Does this help with evaluating the maxims?

::: {.fragment}
Relation:

- Help resolve the QUD.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Quantity (Part 1):

- Resolve it as much as possible.

## On the right track?

(@ex-quantity-qud) **Jo**: How many cookies did Mary eat? <br>
	**Bo**: Mary ate some of the cookies.
	
::: {.fragment}
::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-no-quantity-qud) **Jo**: Is there any evidence against them? <br>
	**Bo**: Some of their identity documents are forgeries.
:::
	
(Based on example from @levinson_presumptive_2000.)

## Dealing with the symmetry problem

Possibility:
certain lexical items are associated with *scales* [@horn_semantic_1972].

- none < some < all, every
- one < two < three
- decent < great < fantastic!

::: {.fragment}
How might this help with the symmetry problem?
