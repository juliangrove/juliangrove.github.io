# Linguistic convention

## @lewis_languages_1975's criteria

::: {.nonincremental}
- Everyone conforms.
- Everyone believes the others conform.
- The others conforming provides a reason to conform.
- Preference for conformity (as opposed to non-conformity).
- Optional or arbitrary---there are possible alternatives.
- Common knowledge of the above.

## @lewis_languages_1975 on language

What are *languages*?

- Lewis: collections of pairs of forms and meanings
  - Form: sign, sound, mark, etc.
  - Meaning: set (i.e., collection) of possible states of affairs, things in the world, etc.

::: {.fragment}
What is *language*?

- A human social activity in which people produce certain forms.
:::

## Relating them

Lewis introduces a convention to define language use:

- "...a population P uses a language ξ is a convention of truthfulness and trust in ξ."
  - Truthfulness:
	try never to utter sentences of ξ that are not true in ξ.
  - Trust in ξ:
	impute truthfulness in ξ to others.
	Believe the things that others tell you.

---

## "Language use"

These are *pragmatic* conventions.

::: {.fragment}
What about conventions relating to form?

- syntax, morphology, phonology, phonetics, etc.
- sociolinguistic conventions:
  using a particular register/dialect in particular social setting

## Communication and meaning

@grice_meaning_1957: conceptual analysis of the word 'mean'.

(@ex-weather) This rainy weather _means_ we'll probably be taxiing for a while.

(@ex-gesture) Jo's gesture _means_ that she wants you to walk over.

(@ex-beans) "Bo devoured the beans" _means_ that Bo ate the beans aggressively.

---

## Test 1

(@ex-weather) This rainy weather means we'll probably be taxiing for a while, but in fact, we won't be taxiing for a while.

(@ex-gesture) Jo's gesture means that she wants you to walk over, but in fact, she doesn't want you to walk over.

(@ex-beans) "Bo devoured the beans" means that Bo ate the beans aggressively, but in fact, Bo didn't eat the beans aggressively.

---

## Test 2

(@ex-weather) What is meant by this rainy weather is that we'll be taxiing for a while.

(@ex-gesture) What is meant by Jo's gesture is that she wants you to walk over.

(@ex-beans) What is meant by "Bo devoured the beans" is that Bo ate the beans aggressively.

---

## Test 3

(@ex-weather) Someone meant by this rainy weather that we'll probably be taxiing for a while.

(@ex-gesture) Jo meant by her gesture that she wants you to walk over.

(@ex-beans) Someone meant by "Bo devoured the beans" that Bo ate the beans aggressively.

---

## Natural and non-natural meaning

- 'mean' in the @ex-weather examples:
  describes a _consequence_ relation
- 'mean' in the @ex-gesture and @ex-beans examples:
  some other kind of relation

@grice_meaning_1957:
_natural_ meaning vs. _non-natural_ meaning.
:::

## Non-natural meaning

### Hypothesis 1

Something _means_$_{NN}$ that $p$ if things of its kind tend to produce a belief in an observer that $p$ is true.

- sun being out makes people believe it's daytime...

---

## Non-natural meaning

### Hypothesis 2

Maybe we should factor in intention.

::: {.fragment}
Someone _means_$_{NN}$ that $p$ by something if they **intend** to use that thing to produce the belief in an audience that $p$ is true.
:::

---

## Counterexample

---

## Non-natural meaning

### Hypothesis 3

Maybe we should factor in an **intention for one's intention to be recognized**.

::: {.fragment}
Someone _means_$_{NN}$ that $p$ by something if they intend to produce the belief that $p$ in their audience by that thing, and they intend for their intention to be recognized.
:::

---

## Counterexample

Cutting someone off in traffic to make them think you're aggressive and to get them to get out of your way.<br>

---

## Non-natural meaning

### What it actually is (according to Grice)

::: {.fragment}
Someone _means_$_{NN}$ that $p$ by something if they intend that:

- their audience comes to believe $p$ because of it,
- their audience recognizes their intention, and
- their audience comes to believe that $p$ specifically *because* of the intention.
:::

---

## Question 1

How to go from "someone meant that $p$ by $X$" to "$p$ means $X$ in a particular linguistic community"?

- Tie in @lewis_languages_1975?

---

## Question 2

How do we characterize meanings for things which aren't statements?

- Commands?
- Questions?
