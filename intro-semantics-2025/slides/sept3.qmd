# Speech acts (cont'd)

## Last time

How @austin_how_1962 classifies speech acts:

- as **locutionary acts**
- in terms of their **illocutionary effects**
- in terms of their **perlocutionary effects**
 
::: {.fragment}
Example:

- Jo ate the chicken salad. (decl., assertion)
- Did Jo eat the chicken salad? (inter., question)
- Eat the chicken salad! (imper., command)
:::

## Last time

Uptake:

- An illocutionary act has **uptake** when it has the "intended social consequence".

::: {.fragment}
Example:

- I bet you $300 that it's raining.
:::

---

## Last time

Those were **direct speech acts**.

<br>

::: {.fragment}
**Indirect speech acts**:
illocutionary act arises as a consequence of some other some other, more basic illocutionary act.

- Could you please pass the salt? <span class="fragment">(inter., request)</span>
- I still haven't gotten my reimbursement. <span class="fragment">(decl., request)</span>

## Performatives

A class of speech acts distinguished by @austin_how_1962.

(@ex-command-beans-declarative) I [command]{.underline} you to help me cook the beans!
	- locutionary act: declarative sentence
	- illocutionary act: command
	- uptake: obligation accepted

(@ex-titanic) I hereby [name]{.underline} this ship the R.M.S. Titanic!
	- locutionary act: declarative sentence
	- illocutionary act: naming
	- uptake: ship's name is now 'R.M.S. Titanic'

---

## Performatives

(@ex-marriage) I [promise]{.underline} to stop moving furniture while you're sleeping.
	- locutionary act: declarative sentence
	- illocutionary act: promise
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">promise accepted, obligation registered</span>
	
(@ex-apology) I [apologize]{.underline}.
	- illocutionary act: apology
	- uptake: ??

---

## Performatives

(@ex-marriage) I do.
	- illocutionary act: vow
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">obligation registered</span>
	
(@ex-bet) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- illocutionary act: bet
	- uptake: bet accepted

## Felicity conditions

You can't just perform any speech act haphazardly.

![](images/boat_names.jpg){fig-align="center"}

---

## Felicity conditions

(@ex-apology) I apologize.
	- The speaker should have done something that requires an apology.
	- The speaker should feel regret.
	
(@ex-marriage) I do.
	- There should be a vow at stake ("...till death do us part?").
	
---

## Felicity conditions

(@ex-command) Open the window!
	- The utterer should have the relevant authority.


(@ex-bet) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- The utterer should have the means to procure $300.

(@ex-congrats) Congratulations!
	- The utterer must actually be pleased.

(@ex-advise) I advise you to do the readings.
	- I should think you should do the readings.

---

## Felicity conditions

In general:

- It must be allowable, by convention, for the speech act to have the illocutionary effect that it is intended to have.
- The circumstances prior to the act have to be appropriate.

---

## Performatives redux

Question 1

- What do performatives and other speech acts have in common?
  How are they different?

::: {.fragment}
Question 2

- How does do locutionary acts fit into the distinction of @grice_meaning_1957 between meaning$_{NN}$ and meaning$_{N}$?
- Illocutionary effects?
- Perlocutionary effects?
:::

---

## More on felicity conditions

- Performatives tend to have felicity conditions.
- What about other types of speech act?

(@ex-lights) Jo: Is Pascal's closed? <br> Bo: The lights are out.
	- Implies there are lights.
	- (May also imply that Pascal's is closed.)

---

## Presupposition

A well-studied type of felicity condition on speech acts.

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Apparently affects them uniformly.
:::

(@ex-lights-q) Are the lights are out?

(@ex-lights-imp) Turn out the lights!

::: {.fragment}
Both imply that there are lights.

## Aspectual predicates

(@ex-stop-smoking) Jo stopped smoking cigarettes.
	- ↝ Jo used to smoke cigarettes.

(@ex-continue-smoking) Jo continued smoking cigarettes.
	- ↝ Jo used to smoke cigarettes.

---

## More aspectual inferences

(@ex-still-smoking) Jo still smokes cigarettes.
	- ↝ Jo used to smoke cigarettes.

(@ex-yet-smoking) Does Jo smoke cigarettes yet?
	- ↝ Jo is going to smoke cigarettes.

---

## Factive predicates

(@ex-love) Jo loves that Bo stopped smoking.
	- ↝ Bo used to smoke.
	- ↝ Bo stopped smoking.

(@ex-hate) Jo hates that it's raining.
	- ↝ It's raining.

---

## Something weird

(@ex-hate-conditional) If it's raining, then Jo hates that it's raining.
	- ↝ ?

(@ex-still-conditional) If Jo used to smoke cigarettes, then she still does.
	- ↝ ?

::: {.fragment}
Where'd they go?
:::

---

## Summary

Felicity conditions:

- Some kinds of felicity conditions pertain to specific illocutionary act types.
  - commands, bets, apologies, etc.
  
- Other kinds of felicity conditions (presuppositions) seem to cross-cut speech acts.
