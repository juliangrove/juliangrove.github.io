# Speaker meaning

## Overview

Things we've looked at:

- **Things that people do**:
  use expressions of their language to create certain (conventional) social effects.
  - Categorization of illocutionary effects:
	- performative, assertion, question, ...

::: {.fragment}
Things we *haven't* looked at:

- **How they do it**:
  locutionary act → illocutionary act (?)
:::

---

## Strategy

What we need:

- a (systematic, predictive, comprehensive) story about how people use expressions to perform illocutionary acts

::: {.fragment}
We can work backwards.

- Illocutionary act [↓]{.gb-blue}
  - [Locutionary act]{.gb-blue}
	- syntax
	- [semantics]{.gb-green}

## Some illocutionary acts

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

(@ex-relation) **Context**: Jo and Bo are outside Pascal's, looking in the window. <br> 
	**Jo**: No one's at the cash register. <br>
	**Bo**: The lights are on. <br>
	- Bo's response:
		- Force: assertion
		- Content, Part 1: <span class="fragment">**Pascal's lights are on**</span>
		- Content, Part 2: **Pascal's is open**

## Some illocutionary acts

(@ex-ignorance) **Context**: Jo and Bo get inside Pascal's and are now in line. <br>
	**Jo**: What do you want? <br>
	**Bo**: Something with lots of caffeine.

(@ex-ignorance) **Context**: Bo got an iced matcha latte. <br>
	**Jo**: How is it? <br>
	**Bo**: I think it needs at least three more pumps of syrup.
	
- ↝ Bo's thinks his latte is *too sweet*.

## Explaining illocutionary effects

Has two parts:

- the semantics of the expressions
- general rules for mapping the semantics of expressions onto meanings in context

---

## An *extremely* general rule

@grice_logic_1975 proposes the **Cooperative Principle**:

- *"Make your conversational contribution, such as is required, at the stage at which is occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."*

::: {.fragment}
Basic hypotheses:

- Humans are rational agents.
- They are cooperative.
- Meaning arises from principles of rational cooperation.
:::

---

## Maxims

Grice describe four maxims:

- Quality
- Quantity
- Relation
- Manner

---

## Quality

Part 1:
only say that which you believe to be true.

::: {.fragment}
Part 2:
only say that which you have enough evidence for.
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Who else said something like this?
:::

---

## Quantity

Part 1:
make your contribution as informative as necessary.

::: {.fragment}
Part 2:
don't overdo it.

![](images/talking.webp){width="300px"}
:::

---

## Relation

Make your contribution relevant.

---

## Manner

Four parts:

- Avoid obscurity.
- Avoid ambiguity.
- Be brief.
- Be orderly.

---

## First example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-relation) **Context**: Jo and Bo are outside Pascal's, looking in the window. <br> 
	**Jo**: No one's at the cash register. <br>
	**Bo**: The lights are on.
		
**Implicature**:
Pascal's is open.

:::

- relation

::: {.fragment}
How? <span class="fragment">Followed.</span>
:::

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/pascals.jpg){width="300px" height="400px"}
:::

::::

---

## Second example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-ignorance) **Context**: Jo and Bo get inside Pascal's and are now in line. <br>
	**Jo**: What do you want? <br>
	**Bo**: Something with lots of caffeine.

**Implicature**:
Bo doesn't know what he wants.
:::

- quality
- quantity

::: {.fragment}
How? <span class="fragment">Clash.</span>
:::

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/pascals2.jpg){width="300px" height="400px"}
:::

::::

---

## Third example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

::: {.nonincremental}

(@ex-ignorance) **Context**: Bo got an iced matcha latte. <br>
	**Jo**: How is it? <br>
	**Bo**: I think it needs at least three more pumps of syrup.

**Implicature**:
Bo thinks his latte is too sweet.
:::

- quality

::: {.fragment}
How? <span class="fragment">Flouted.</span>
:::

:::


::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/pascals3.jpeg){width="300px" height="400px"}
:::

## A few more

(@ex-quantity) John devoured some of the beans.

<br>

(@ex-manner-1) Bo walked to his desk, sat down, and got up.

<br>

(@ex-manner-2) Jo got the car to start.

## Questions

1. How should we understand the CP and the maxims?
   - Do they tell us how to behave?

2. How do they fit into Grice's notion of meaning$_{NN}$?
   - Implicatures:
	 just inferred, or genuinely communicated?

3. Variation?
