    "text": "The most prominent difference between entailments and presuppositions on the one hand, and conversational implicatures on the other, is that the latter tend to be defeasible, while the former tend not to be. Conversational implicatures are defined as arising from the maxims, after all—so you can always just claim that you weren’t actually following them!\n\nThe non-defeasability of entailments\n\n#Jo has at least three siblings, {and, but} she doesn’t have at least two siblings.\n#Jo is Bo’s sibling, {and, but} Jo and Bo aren’t siblings.\n#No one came to class, {and, but} it’s not the case that Julian didn’t come to class.\n\nEach of these examples seems to be weird and contradictory. That’s because an entailment of the first clause in each example is negated in the second clause. That is, Jo has at least three siblings entails Jo has at least two siblings; Jo is Bo’s sibling entails Jo and Bo are siblings; and no one came to class entails Julian didn’t come to class.\n\n\nThe non-defeasibility of presuppositions\nLike entailments, presuppositions also appear to be non-defeasible.\n\n#Jo stopped smoking, {and, but} she didn’t used to smoke.\n#Jo loves that it’s raining, {and, but} it’s not raining.\n#Bo failed the assignment, {and, but} there isn’t an assignment.\n#Bo failed the assignment again, {and, but} he hasn’t failed it before.\n\n\n\nThe defeasibility of conversational implicatures\n\nJo did some of the readings. In fact, she did all of them.\nI want something with lots of caffeine. In fact, I want a matcha latte.\nContext: Jo is writing a letter of recommendation for Bo for a linguistics instructor position.  Jo: Bo is very punctual. He has great handwriting. He kicked my ass in Hungry Hungry Hippos. Last, but not least, he’d be a great instructor in your linguistics program!\n\nThese examples illustrate that conversational implicatures, unlike entailments, may be canceled. In (8), the implicature that Jo did not do all of the readings is canceled; in (9), the ignorance implicature is canceled; and in (10), the implicature that Bo should not be hired as a linguistics instructor that arises when Jo flouts relation is canceled.",

    "text": "The data we tend to be interested in in semantics is inference judgment data. We can view an inference as being a pair of expressions of the language (or utterances of such expressions)—\\(E_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2}\\)—where \\(E_{2}\\) is generally a declarative sentence. In that case, we can ask if using \\(E_{1}\\) triggers an inference that \\(E_{2}\\) is true. If it does, then we say that \\(E_{2}\\) is an inference of \\(E_{1}\\) (or of an utterance of \\(E_{1}\\)).\nThere are four kinds of inference that we’d like to be able to classify. These are:\n\nentailments\nconversational implicatures\npresuppositions\nconventional implicatures\n\nEach of these kinds of inference can itself be viewed as a relation between expressions, or utterances of expressions. For example, we can say that sentence 1 entails sentence 2, or that it conversationally implicates it. Strictly speaking, it is really an utterance of a sentence that would trigger a conversational implicature—one wherefrom it is assumed that the person making the utterance is following certain conversational principles—but linguists often say that a sentence triggers a conversational implicature as a shorthand to mean that utterances of the sentence tend to give rise to the implicature.\nLikewise, expressions of different syntactic categories can presuppose certain sentences, or they can conventionally implicate them.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lewis’s goal in Lewis (1975) is to understand what is involved when a community of language users knows a language. Because he views language use in a community as the adoption by that community of a particular convention, he lays out a number of criteria that he thinks conventions, in general, ought to satisfy. According to Lewis, any given habit or practice that persists within some community is a convention just in case the following hold:\n\nEveryone conforms, i.e., participates in the habit.\nEveryone believes the other members of the community conform.\nThe other members of the community conforming provides a reason to conform.\nPeople generally prefer for the other members of the community to conform, rather than not conform.\nThe habit is optional or arbitrary, in the sense that it is selected from among some set of available alternative possible habits.\nThere is common knowledge within the community of the above criteria. That is, each community member knows (in some sense) about the convention, expects others to know about it, and expects others to have similar expectations.1\n\nHere, Lewis is engaged in what’s called “conceptual analysis”: he takes an ordinary English expression (convention), which English speakers regularly use with, perhaps at best, an implicit understanding of how it is used, and he attempts to elaborate necessary and sufficient conditions for its application. That is, Lewis takes conditions 1 through 6 to define the term convention. They all have to hold (they are necessary), and only they have to hold (they are sufficient), in order for something to be a convention. Why does he do this? Well in part, because he thinks the criteria in 1 - 6 isolate and shed light on an interesting array of phenomena that exist among our species—driving on the right vs. left of the road (depending on where one lives), greeting people in a particular way, knocking on doors to request entry, and a zillion other things; and in part, because as a philosopher of language, he thinks one of these kinds of phenomena—linguistic conventions—is particularly interesting. Does convention, when understood as abbreviating the conditions 1 through 6, have the same meaning as the ordinary English word convention? Maybe, maybe not. It doesn’t really matter very much for our purposes, since we just want a basic way of narrowing in on the phenomenon we’re studying (language, communication, meaning, etc.), along with, perhaps, what important features it has in common with certain other practices that people engage in.\nOne of the candidate conventions we looked at was teeth-brushing. I’ll go through the criteria here to see how well they apply to this particular practice.\n\n\n\nIt’s true that not everyone conforms (or always conforms), but not conforming is often noticed or frowned upon—something which at least appears to be true of genuine conventions, in general.\nWith certain exceptions, people expect each other to conform; this case doesn’t seem out of the ordinary for established conventions.\nIt is perhaps a little bit tricky to determine whether others brushing their teeth provides a reason for one to brush one’s own teeth. On the one hand, the main reasons people brush their teeth are to help prevent cavities and to not have bad breath. On the other hand, not having bad breath—while (or because) people believe it makes interactions with other people more pleasant—is often expected. In fact, there might exist a standard in societies in which teeth-brushing is common, according to which people shouldn’t be perceived as having bad breath; further, this standard may be reinforced when people actually do brush their teeth: the more people engage in the practice, the more social pressure there is to conform. If we entertain this possibility, it appears that other people brushing their teeth can provide a reason for one to brush one’s own teeth.\nThere appears to be a general preference that people brush their teeth. For one, people are often concerned about others’ hygiene because it affects their own experience (e.g., they don’t want to smell someone else’s bad breath). But also—insofar as standards of hygiene and cleanliness are arbitrary and culturally variable—I suspect people want to not have wasted their effort when they brush their own teeth. They might want their action to be justified, in part, by the existence of the standard. (Just think of how many people might stop brushing their teeth if the people around them stopped—probably at least a few?)\nWhether or not teeth-brushing is optional or arbitrary may also seem tricky to determine. On the one hand, it might not be clear what other practice would allow people to keep their teeth clean; on the other hand, it is a bit clearer what alternative practice might allow members of a community to adhere to a communal standard: the practice of not brushing your teeth. That is, we would just have to change the standard, and suddenly, people would be relieved of the social pressure to brush one’s teeth with which it coincides.\nInsofar as the above observations are accurate, they appear to be common knowledge. Common enough, at least, that you might expect to hear a reminder if you go to the dentist.\n\nI think there’s a good argument that teeth-brushing is (sometimes) a convention: it’s a convention when the community in which it is done adopts a standard (e.g., having healthy teeth, not being perceived as having bad breath)—one that teeth-brushing helps people meet. There might, of course, be other reasons to brush your teeth than the fact that it’s a convention.",

    "text": "Due on Friday, September 5th.\n\nPart 1\nPick one of the other practices that were brought up in class, and give an analysis of whether or not it meets criteria 1-5 outlined in Defining convention. To remind you, these practices were:\n\nKnocking on the door before entering a room\nLooking both ways before crossing the street\nUsing an umbrella when it’s raining\nMaking WiFi free available to customers at coffee shops\n\nAlternatively, pick your own practice to analyze, and do the same. Whatever practice you choose need not be well-known, and we need not generally be consciously aware of its existence. It just needs to be something that people do within some community with which you’re familiar. (Please don’t use one of the ones that Lewis (1975) mentions, e.g., driving on a particular side of the road in a particular country.) You might use the discussion in these notes of ‘brushing your teeth’ as a model. Note—following those notes—that some aspects of the practice might appear to be conventional, while other aspects might seem less so. If you notice that this is true of the practice you analyze, please point it out.\nPlease consider and provide a response to the following question: is your analysis of the practice you’ve chosen consistent with your own intuitions about whether or not the practice is a convention?\n\n\nPart 2\nConsider the following state of affairs. Jo utters the sentence in (1) after her laptop freezes.\n\nThis damn computer is so slow!\n\nThere are a number of inferences you might draw based on this utterance. For example:\n\nThere is a computer.\nThe computer exceeds some degree of slowness, perhaps salient in the context of utterance, which is particularly high.\nJo is frustrated by her computer.\n\nThe last inference—that Jo is frustrated—appears to be triggered by her use of the word damn. In general, such words (called expressives) give rise to inferences of this kind, e.g., about an attitude held by the person who utters them; in this case, we draw an inference about Jo’s attitude toward her laptop.\nThis use of the word damn, which causes the frustration inference, appears, in some sense to mean that Jo is frustrated. Do you think that this notion of meaning is meaning\\(_{N}\\) or meaning\\(_{NN}\\)? That is, which of these relates utterances of (1)—or sentences containing the word damn, more generally—to inferences about frustration? Explain why, using the criteria for meaning\\(_{NN}\\) that Grice discusses.\n\n\nPart 3\nConsider the following different state of affairs. Bo maintains two forms of the verb be that he uses in the antecedents of counterfactual conditional sentences. For example, sometimes he utters sentences like (2)\n\nIf I was buying ice cream, I would probably get chocolate.\n\nwhile at other times he utters sentences like (3).\n\nIf I were buying ice cream, I would probably get chocolate.\n\nIn the first set of cases (exemplified by (2)), he inflects be as was when the subject is I, he, she, or a singular noun phrase, and as were when the subject is we, you, they, or a plural noun phrase. Meanwhile, in the second set of cases, (exemplified by (3)), he inflects be as were regardless of the person or number of the subject.\nImportantly, he tends to use these forms of be in this way in somewhat different social contexts. He is more likely to utter sentences like (2) (be -&gt; was) when he is with his friends or family or buying something at the grocery store (i.e., “informal” settings); while he is more likely to utter sentences like (3) (be -&gt; were) when he is answering a question in class or writing a paper (i.e., “formal” settings). In both cases, he appears to be signaling, in one way or another, something about his identity as a speaker of English and his relationship to his interlocutors. In the first set of contexts, he is not trying to speak “correctly” according to a received standard about spoken or written English, while in the second set of contexts, it is important to him that his English sound “correct”, and that his interlocutors draw the inference that he speaks English according to a particular formal standard.\nDo you think that the inference about Bo’s “correct” use of English in these contexts, i.e., when he uses were in cases in which he might otherwise use was is related to meaning\\(_{N}\\) or meaning\\(_{NN}\\)? In other words, in which sense of mean does Bo’s use of the form of the verb be mean that he uses English “correctly”? In the sense relevant to natural meaning, or in the sense relevant to non-natural meaning? Again, explain why, making reference to the criteria outlined by Grice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLewis, David K. 1975. “Languages and Language.” In Arguing about Language, edited by Darragh Byrne and Max Kölbel.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since our general goal is to give an account of conventional meaning—the type of meaning that users of a language associate with expressions by convention, in a way that allows them to deploy those expressions to communicate in real conversational settings—it would be useful to first get a handle on some general conversational principles about how expressions with certain meanings are deployed. Having observed inferences in real-life language use, we can hopefully then work out which of those inferences are related to conventional meaning and which are related to general (and perhaps, to some extent, non-linguistic) social conventions about conversation itself.\nWith this aim partly in mind, Grice (1975) proposes a principle that he takes to regulate real-life conversation: the Cooperative Principle.\n\nThe Cooperative Principle:  “Make your conversational contribution, such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged” (p. 45).\n\n(Will do 😅!) More seriously, Grice thinks that this principle should be seen as implicitly regulating what people decide to say to one another, and he tries to give the principle a little bit of heft by saying what maxims people appear to follow in order to adhere to it.\nHe proposes four general maxims:\n\nQuality\nQuantity\nRelation\nManner\n\n\nQuality\nThe maxim of Quality has two parts: first, don’t say things that you think are false; and second, only say things that you have enough evidence for.\nGrice doesn’t say much about what, in general, constitutes “enough evidence”—presumably this is meant to be understood as somewhat context-dependent. For example, if you’re a surgeon in an operating room, the standard of evidence for certain kinds of assertions would likely be pretty high (“The tibial plateau is misaligned by three degrees.”), whereas if you’re a contestant on Jeopardy, it’s generally likely to be lower. Indeed (as is the case for all of Grice’s maxims), there are many details to fill in here! But we can still get a certain amount of reasoning off the ground about why certain utterances mean what they do, even with while leaving a lot underspecified.\n\n\nQuantity\nThe maxim of Quantity is also stated by Grice as having two parts: first, be as informative as necessary; second, don’t overdo it!\nAgain, Grice leaves out crucial information about how this maxim ought to be evaluated—what counts as “as informative as necessary” or “overdo[ing] it”? As we saw, it’s possible to give a more systematic account of what counts as too little or too much information if we have access to the notion of a question under discussion (QUD; Roberts (2012)). For example, if the question is how many children does John have?, an answer which is under-informative might be John has between three and five children, while an answer that might be over-informative might be John has exactly three children, and they all go to the same high school. Intriguingly, it is perhaps also possible for an answer to both under- and over-informative, e.g., John has between three and five children, and they all go to the same high school. The answer which is “just right”, given the question, might then be John has exactly three children.\nImportant to note is that this addition really only works if we have two things. First, we need a way of knowing when some question is the QUD of a particular conversation or discourse; and second, we need a definition of when a given statement answers a question, either partially or completely. The problem of identifying QUDs is a matter of ongoing research in both computational and experimental pragmatics—it’s hard (though language users might generally seem to solve it fairly effortlessly).\nMeanwhile, the problem of defining when a statement answers a question is perhaps somewhat easier, insofar as there are several theories of question meanings on the market, and any of them might in principle tell us what the possible complete and partial answers to a QUD are, once one has been identified.\n\n\nRelation\nThe maxim of Relation is stated as follows: be relevant.\nThat is, don’t be like zombie kid. This maxim can also be made a little more systematic by taking it to constraint the relationship between statements made in some conversation and the QUD of the conversation: it seems to say that one should make statements that answer the QUD, or at least partially answer it.\n\n\nManner\nThe maxim of Manner is taken by Grice to dictate that one should be clear, unambiguous, brief, and orderly.\nWhether or not a particular utterance adheres to this maxim might seem to be somewhat in the eye of the beholder. For example, what counts as “brief”—should we count the number of segments, syllables, words, constituent phrases used (does it depend?)? Ideally, such criteria would be open to empirical investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGrice, H. P. 1975. “Logic and Conversation.” In Syntax and Semantics, edited by Peter Cole and Jerry L.

Each written assignments will be a collection of responses to questions: some of these responses will have a mini-essay format, and some will be more like answers to problem sets (it’ll be clear in any given case what the expectation is). Each assignment will be available on this site, at the end of the set of notes to which the assignment corresponds. Please turn in a physical copy of your responses at the beginning of the class on which the assignment is due.\nThe written assignments will be graded on a 5-point scale, using the following rubric:\n\n5: you thoroughly engage with each question on the assignment. This means that you justify each of your responses, as well point out its implications, if appropriate. For example, if the truth of your response is likely to have any unintuitive consequences, you should note and explain these. Doing this well will sometimes be challenging and require you to think a lot.\nIf the assignment has questions requiring the application of analytical techniques that we have introduced in the course, “thorough engagement”, for current purposes, means applying these techniques in the right way.\n4: you thoroughly engage with most, but not all, of the questions.\n3: you thoroughly engage with only a small part of the assignment and give shallow or cursory answers to most of it.\n2: you give shallow or cursory answers to all of the questions on the assignment.\n1: you barely do the assignment.\n0: you don’t even barely do the assignment.\n\nThe written assignments will account for 90% of your grade, and the final exam, for 10%. The final will take place from 10am-12pm on December 10th (place TBD). It will be formatted similarly to the assignments.\nThe following grading scale will be used to determine course grades:\n\n\n\n93.5 ≤ A ≤ 100\n89.5 ≤ A- &lt; 93.5\n\n\n\n86.5 ≤ B+ &lt; 89.5\n83.5 ≤ B &lt; 86.5\n79.5 ≤ B- &lt; 83.5\n\n\n76.5 ≤ C+ &lt; 79.5\n74.5 ≤ C &lt; 76.5\n69.5 ≤ C &lt; 74.5\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration (including with chatbots)\nWe’ll talk about this in class. Basically:\n\nPlease actually do the readings yourself.\nPlease complete assignments yourself.\nIf you worked with someone else in the class (or a chatbot) on an assignment, please indicate that you did. If you used a chatbot, please include a note with your assignment describing how you used it.\n\n\n\nMissed or late work\nLate work will not be accepted unless you’ve arranged with me beforehand. If you need an extension, ask for one—just do it prior to the due date.\n\n\nExtra credit\nIf you like, you can get extra credit, accounting for up to an additional 2% of your course grade, in one of two ways:\n\nYou can earn up to two credits by participating in linguistics studies through the Linguistics Department’s SONA account (so, one percentage point of your grade per credit). This document has more information; so does this video. If you go this route, please participate in the studies before November 22.\nYou can read and summarize the main arguments of a (short) semantics paper, i.e., published in a journal, collection, or conference proceedings. Here are some paper suggestions (which I will continue to add to during the semester), but note that you can also summarize a paper of your choosing, so long as you consult with me about it first.\n\nKarttunen (1971)\nKlecha (2014)\nSteinert-Threlkeld et al.

    "text": "Like Lewis (1975), Grice (1957) is engaged in conceptual analysis, but of the English word ‘meaning’. To help pump our intuitions about the distinct ways this word is used, he provides examples analogous to the following:\n\nThis rainy weather means we’ll probably be taxiing for a while.\nJo’s gesture means that she wants you to walk over.\n“Bo devoured the beans” means that Bo ate the beans aggressively.\n\nThe differences among the uses of mean in (1-3) may not be obvious at a single glance, but Grice introduces a number of tests that seem to tease these uses apart.\nWe’ll go through these again now, starting with what I’ll call the contraction test.\n\n\nThis test coordinates the original sentence with a sentence that contradicts the clause selected by mean in the original.\n\n#This rainy weather means we’ll probably be taxiing for a while, but in fact, we won’t be taxiing for a while.\nJo’s gesture means that she wants you to walk over, but in fact, she doesn’t want you to walk over.\n“Bo devoured the beans” means that Bo ate the beans aggressively, but in fact, Bo didn’t eat the beans aggressively.\n\nI’ve marked (1) with a ‘#’ in order to indicate that it is perceived as odd; in particular, it appears to be a contradiction: the use of mean seems to imply the truth of the clause that it selects (we’ll probably be taxiing for a while), while the coordinated clause contradicts it. Meanwhile, (2) and (3) don’t coincide with similar oddness, which suggests that the coordinated clause does not result in a contradiction. (You might feel that the second sentence of (2) is unexpected, but this is likely due to the fact that it describes an odd state of affairs—one in which Jo made the gesture accidentally or as a form of trickery—rather than because it is an odd sentence.)\n\n\n\nWhat I’ll call the passive test involves passivizing the verb mean from the original sentences. The verb is also placed inside the subject of a pseudo-cleft construction, though other tests that involve passivizing and pseud-clefting on their own would suggest that it is really the passive that distinguishes the different uses of mean.1\n\n#What is meant by this rainy weather is that we’ll be taxiing for a while.\nWhat is meant by Jo’s gesture is that she wants you to walk over.\nWhat is meant by “Bo devoured the beans” is that Bo ate the beans aggressively.\n\nHere again, (1) pulls apart from (2) and (3).\n\n\n\nLast, but not least, is what I’ll call the agentivity test. This test modifies the original sentences by combining mean with an agentive subject (and putting the original subject into a by-phrase).\n\n#Someone meant by this rainy weather that we’ll probably be taxiing for a while.\nJo meant by her gesture that she wants you to walk over.\nSomeone meant by “Bo devoured the beans” that Bo ate the beans aggressively.\n\nHey check it out! (1) again pulls apart from (2) and (3).",

Bo: It was interesting.\n\nEach of these examples can be understood as involving a conversational implicature. (1) appears to give rise to the implicature that the speaker doesn’t know if it’s raining outside. Meanwhile, (2) seems to imply that Bo may have found the movie less than fantastic. Assuming these implicatures are intended, what conversational maxims are involved in generating them? How are the conversational maxims deployed in each case—go through the reasoning involved (kind of like I did here). For either one, are there other principles, besides the four conversational maxims, that might be in play?\n\n\nPart 2\nRecall where I mentioned that the sentence in (3) appears to give rise to a scalar implicature, while Bo’s utterance in (4) appears to give rise to an ignorance implicature. The reasoning that is typically hypothesized to generate both implicatures is similar; for example, both the Quantity and Quality maxims are invoked.\n\nJo did some of the readings.\nJo: What do you want?  Bo: Something with a lot of caffeine.\n\nWhat difference(s) between these examples might help explain why you observe only an ignorance implicature in (4)? How does this difference affect the reasoning involved in deriving the implicatures?\n\n\nPart 3\nConsider the examples in (5) and (6).\n\nJo proved that her trunk was empty.  ↝ Jo’s trunk was empty.\nBo doesn’t like his sandwich.  ↝ Bo dislikes his sandwich.\n\nWhat is the status of each of these inferences? That is, is it an entailment, a conversational implicature, a presupposition, a conventional implicature, or not obviously any of these?",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Disappearing presuppositions\nOne well-studied feature of presuppositions is that, despite the fact that they tend to project, they can also be canceled (or sometimes, modified) under certain circumstances. For example, consider the following cases, in which sentences that normally display presuppositions are made the consequent clauses of certain conditional sentences:\n\nIf Bo has a dog, he brought the dog to his place of work.\nIf Jo is actually good at Go, she loves that she’s good at Go.\n\nIn (1), a sentence that entails there is a dog—the usual presupposition of the consequent clause—is the antecedent of the conditional. In (2), the sentence which is usually the presupposition of the consequent clause is made the antecedent of the conditional. In each case, the entire conditionals themselves don’t appear to have the relevant presuppositions: (1), taken as a whole, does not imply that there is a dog; nor does (2) imply that Jo is good at Go.\nWe obtain a similar pattern if we conjoin the antecedent sentences of these conditionals with the corresponding consequent sentences, and then negate the coordinate structure that result:\n\nIt’s not true that Bo has a dog and that he brought the dog to his place of work.\nIt’s not true that Jo is good at Go and that she loves that she’s good at Go.\n\n\n\nConventional implicatures project\nLike presuppositions, conventional implicatures show projection behavior when subjected to family-of-sentence tests. Consider the example in (4), which features a conventional implicature triggered by a non-restrictive relative clause.\n\nThe class is taught by Julian, who enjoys syntax.\n\nThis sentence implies that Julian enjoys syntax. Like a presupposition, this inference appears to project under negation:\n\nThe class isn’t taught by Julian, who enjoys syntax.\n\nSame with questioning the sentence and placing it into the antecedent of a conditional, which you can check.\nWhat’s notable about conventional implicatures is that if you try to cancel them using means similar to those described above, the result is a bit odd:\n\n#If Julian enjoys syntax, then the class is taught by Julian, who enjoys syntax.\n\nThis sounds weird, suggesting that the conventional implicature is forced to project; that is, what may make this conditional sentence odd is that it triggers the inference that Julian enjoys syntax—due to the non-restrictive relative clause—while at the same time, the fact that Julian enjoys syntax is the antecedent the conditional may trigger an ignorance implicature, i.e., that the utterer doesn’t know whether or not Julian enjoys syntax. So, on the one hand, the utterer believes Julian enjoys syntax (i.e., the conventional implicature), while on the other hand, they are conversationally implicating that they don’t know whether or not he does. (Or something along those lines :).)\nThe point here is that this apparent difference between presuppositions and conventional implicatures can provide a kind of test that helps distinguish between them. For a given candidate presupposition or conventional implicature \\(S\\), ask yourself, “Can I place \\(S\\) into the consequent of a conditional sentence in the way described above, so that it is canceled?” If so, you may have a presupposition. If not (because the result is weird), you may have a conventional implicature.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Entailments and presuppositions are typically distinguished by family-of -sentence tests (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 1990). Given a sentence which appears to have some entailment or presupposition, one may negate the sentence, turn it into a polar question, or place it into the antecedent of a conditional. If the inference projects (or survives), then we have evidence that it is a presupposition; if it does not, then we have evidence that it is an entailment.\nFor example, both the clause-selecting verbs love and demonstrate appear to give rise to the inference that the clause they select is true;\n\n\nJo demonstrated that she’s good at Go. \nJo loves that she’s good at Go.\n\n\nbut the following examples illustrate that these inferences behave differently under negation.\n\n\nJo didn’t demonstrate that she’s good at Go. \nJo doesn’t love that she’s good at Go.\n\n\nLikewise, under questioning:\n\n\nDid Jo demonstrate that she’s good at Go?\nDoes Jo love that she’s good at Go?\n\n\nSimilarly, when we place the original sentences into the antecedent of a larger conditional sentence:\n\n\nIf Jo demonstrated that she’s good at Go, she’ll have to join the Go league. \nIf Jo loves that she’s good at Go, she’ll have to join the Go league.\n\n\nIn each case, the inference that the clause selected by love is true survives, while the inference that the clause selected by demonstrate is true does not.\nWe observe the same pattern when exchanging an indefinite determiner in some sentence with a definite determiner, suggesting that when an indefinite determiner trigger an entailment, an indefinite determiner triggers a corresponding presupposition.\n\n\nBo brought a dog to his place of work. \nBo brought the dog to his place of work.\n\n\nIn both of these sentences, we observe the inference that there is a dog. If we negate both sentences,\n\n\nBo didn’t bring a dog to his place of work. \nBo didn’t bring the dog to his place of work.\n\n\nwe observe that the inference persists only when there is a definite determiner. Analogous results obtain when we question the original sentences or place them into the antecedents of conditional sentences.\n\n\nDid Bo bring a dog to his place of work? \nDid Bo bring the dog to his place of work?\n\n\nIf Bo brought a dog to his place of work, the boss will be mad. \nIf Bo brought the dog to his place of work, the boss will be mad.",
