    "text": "Like Lewis (1975), Grice (1957) is engaged in conceptual analysis, but of the English word ‘meaning’. To help pump our intuitions about the distinct ways this word is used, he provides examples analogous to the following:\n\nThis rainy weather means we’ll probably be taxiing for a while.\nJo’s gesture means that she wants you to walk over.\n“Bo devoured the beans” means that Bo ate the beans aggressively.\n\nThe differences among the uses of mean in (1-3) may not be obvious at a single glance, but Grice introduces a number of tests that seem to tease these uses apart.\nWe’ll go through these again now, starting with what I’ll call the contraction test.\n\n\nThis test coordinates the original sentence with a sentence that contradicts the clause selected by mean in the original.\n\n#This rainy weather means we’ll probably be taxiing for a while, but in fact, we won’t be taxiing for a while.\nJo’s gesture means that she wants you to walk over, but in fact, she doesn’t want you to walk over.\n“Bo devoured the beans” means that Bo ate the beans aggressively, but in fact, Bo didn’t eat the beans aggressively.\n\nI’ve marked (1) with a ‘#’ in order to indicate that it is perceived as odd; in particular, it appears to be a contradiction: the use of mean seems to imply the truth of the clause that it selects (we’ll probably be taxiing for a while), while the coordinated clause contradicts it. Meanwhile, (2) and (3) don’t coincide with similar oddness, which suggests that the coordinated clause does not result in a contradiction. (You might feel that the second sentence of (2) is unexpected, but this is likely due to the fact that it describes an odd state of affairs—one in which Jo made the gesture accidentally or as a form of trickery—rather than because it is an odd sentence.)\n\n\n\nWhat I’ll call the passive test involves passivizing the verb mean from the original sentences. The verb is also placed inside the subject of a pseudo-cleft construction, though other tests that involve passivizing and pseud-clefting on their own would suggest that it is really the passive that distinguishes the different uses of mean.1\n\n#What is meant by this rainy weather is that we’ll be taxiing for a while.\nWhat is meant by Jo’s gesture is that she wants you to walk over.\nWhat is meant by “Bo devoured the beans” is that Bo ate the beans aggressively.\n\nHere again, (1) pulls apart from (2) and (3).\n\n\n\nLast, but not least, is what I’ll call the agentivity test. This test modifies the original sentences by combining mean with an agentive subject (and putting the original subject into a by-phrase).\n\n#Someone meant by this rainy weather that we’ll probably be taxiing for a while.\nJo meant by her gesture that she wants you to walk over.\nSomeone meant by “Bo devoured the beans” that Bo ate the beans aggressively.\n\nHey check it out! (1) again pulls apart from (2) and (3).",

    "text": "Assignments and grading\n\nGrading\nYour work in this course will consist of nine (9) short written assignments—sometimes based on assigned readings—as well as an in-person final exam. Each written assignments will be a collection of responses to questions: some of these responses will have a mini-essay format, and some will be more like answers to problem sets (it’ll be clear in any given case what the expectation is). Each assignment will be available on this site, at the end of the set of notes to which the assignment corresponds. Please turn in a physical copy of your responses at the beginning of the class on which the assignment is due.\nThe written assignments will be graded on a 5-point scale, using the following rubric:\n\n5: you thoroughly engage with each question on the assignment. This means that you justify each of your responses, as well point out its implications, if appropriate. For example, if the truth of your response is likely to have any unintuitive consequences, you should note and explain these. Doing this well will sometimes be challenging and require you to think a lot.\nIf the assignment has questions requiring the application of analytical techniques that we have introduced in the course, “thorough engagement”, for current purposes, means applying these techniques in the right way.\n4: you thoroughly engage with most, but not all, of the questions.\n3: you thoroughly engage with only a small part of the assignment and give shallow or cursory answers to most of it.\n2: you give shallow or cursory answers to all of the questions on the assignment.\n1: you barely do the assignment.\n0: you don’t even barely do the assignment.\n\nThe written assignments will account for 90% of your grade, and the final exam, for 10%. The final will take place from 10am-12pm on December 10th (place TBD). It will be formatted similarly to the assignments.\nThe following grading scale will be used to determine course grades:\n\n\n\n93.5 ≤ A ≤ 100\n89.5 ≤ A- &lt; 93.5\n\n\n\n86.5 ≤ B+ &lt; 89.5\n83.5 ≤ B &lt; 86.5\n79.5 ≤ B- &lt; 83.5\n\n\n76.5 ≤ C+ &lt; 79.5\n74.5 ≤ C &lt; 76.5\n69.5 ≤ C &lt; 74.5\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration (including with chatbots)\nWe’ll talk about this in class. Basically:\n\nPlease actually do the readings yourself.\nPlease complete assignments yourself.\nIf you worked with someone else in the class (or a chatbot) on an assignment, please indicate that you did. If you used a chatbot, please include a note with your assignment describing how you used it.\n\n\n\nMissed or late work\nLate work will not be accepted unless you’ve arranged with me beforehand. If you need an extension, ask for one—just do it prior to the due date.\n\n\nExtra credit\nIf you like, you can get extra credit, accounting for up to an additional 2% of your course grade, in one of two ways:\n\nYou can earn up to two credits by participating in linguistics studies through the Linguistics Department’s SONA account (so, one percentage point of your grade per credit). This document has more information; so does this video. If you go this route, please participate in the studies before November 22.\nYou can read and summarize the main arguments of a (short) semantics paper, i.e., published in a journal, collection, or conference proceedings. I’ll provide some suggestions of papers soon, but you can also summarize one of your choosing, so long as you consult with me about it first.",

    "text": "Due on Friday, September 5th.\n\nPart 1\nPick one of the other practices that were brought up in class, and give an analysis of whether or not it meets criteria 1-5 outlined in Defining convention. To remind you, these practices were:\n\nKnocking on the door before entering a room\nLooking both ways before crossing the street\nUsing an umbrella when it’s raining\nMaking WiFi free available to customers at coffee shops\n\nAlternatively, pick your own practice to analyze, and do the same. Whatever practice you choose need not be well-known, and we need not generally be consciously aware of its existence. It just needs to be something that people do within some community with which you’re familiar. (Please don’t use one of the ones that Lewis (1975) mentions, e.g., driving on a particular side of the road in a particular country.) You might use the discussion in these notes of ‘brushing your teeth’ as a model. Note—following those notes—that some aspects of the practice might appear to be conventional, while other aspects might seem less so. If you notice that this is true of the practice you analyze, please point it out.\nPlease consider and provide a response to the following question: is your analysis of the practice you’ve chosen consistent with your own intuitions about whether or not the practice is a convention?\n\n\nPart 2\nConsider the following state of affairs. Jo utters the sentence in (1) after her laptop freezes.\n\nThis damn computer is so slow!\n\nThere are a number of inferences you might draw based on this utterance. For example:\n\nThere is a computer.\nThe computer exceeds some degree of slowness, perhaps salient in the context of utterance, which is particularly high.\nJo is frustrated by her computer.\n\nThe last inference—that Jo is frustrated—appears to be triggered by her use of the word damn. In general, such words (called expressives) give rise to inferences of this kind, e.g., about an attitude held by the person who utters them; in this case, we draw an inference about Jo’s attitude toward her laptop.\nThis use of the word damn, which causes the frustration inference, appears, in some sense to mean that Jo is frustrated. Do you think that this notion of meaning is meaning\\(_{N}\\) or meaning\\(_{NN}\\)? That is, which of these relates utterances of (1)—or sentences containing the word damn, more generally—to inferences about frustration? Explain why, using the criteria for meaning\\(_{NN}\\) that Grice discusses.\n\n\nPart 3\nConsider the following different state of affairs. Bo maintains two forms of the verb be that he uses in the antecedents of counterfactual conditional sentences. For example, sometimes he utters sentences like (2)\n\nIf I was buying ice cream, I would probably get chocolate.\n\nwhile at other times he utters sentences like (3).\n\nIf I were buying ice cream, I would probably get chocolate.\n\nIn the first set of cases (exemplified by (2)), he inflects be as was when the subject is I, he, she, or a singular noun phrase, and as were when the subject is we, you, they, or a plural noun phrase. Meanwhile, in the second set of cases, (exemplified by (3)), he inflects be as were regardless of the person or number of the subject.\nImportantly, he tends to use these forms of be in this way in somewhat different social contexts. He is more likely to utter sentences like (2) (be -&gt; was) when he is with his friends or family or buying something at the grocery store (i.e., “informal” settings); while he is more likely to utter sentences like (3) (be -&gt; were) when he is answering a question in class or writing a paper (i.e., “formal” settings). In both cases, he appears to be signaling, in one way or another, something about his identity as a speaker of English and his relationship to his interlocutors. In the first set of contexts, he is not trying to speak “correctly” according to a received standard about spoken or written English, while in the second set of contexts, it is important to him that his English sound “correct”, and that his interlocutors draw the inference that he speaks English according to a particular formal standard.\nDo you think that the inference about Jo’s “correct” use of English in these contexts, i.e., when he uses were in cases in which he might otherwise use was is related to meaning\\(_{N}\\) or meaning\\(_{NN}\\)? In other words, in which sense of mean does Bo’s use of the form of the verb be mean that he uses English “correctly”? In the sense relevant to natural meaning, or in the sense relevant to non-natural meaning? Again, explain why, making reference to the criteria outlined by Grice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLewis, David K. 1975. “Languages and Language.” In Arguing about Language, edited by Darragh Byrne and Max Kölbel.

    "text": "Lewis’s goal in Lewis (1975) is to understand what is involved when a community of language users knows a language. Because he views language use in a community as the adoption by that community of a particular convention, he lays out a number of criteria that he thinks conventions, in general, ought to satisfy. According to Lewis, any given habit or practice that persists within some community is a convention just in case the following hold:\n\nEveryone conforms, i.e., participates in the habit.\nEveryone believes the other members of the community conform.\nThe other members of the community conforming provides a reason to conform.\nThe habit is optional or arbitrary, in the sense that it is selected from among some set of available alternative possible habits.\nThere is common knowledge within the community of the above criteria. That is, each community member knows (in some sense) about the convention, expects others to know about it, and expects others to have similar expectations.1\n\nHere, Lewis is engaged in what’s called “conceptual analysis”: he takes an ordinary English expression (convention), which English speakers regularly use with, perhaps at best, an implicit understanding of how it is used, and he attempts to elaborate necessary and sufficient conditions for its application. That is, Lewis takes conditions 1 through 5 to define the term convention. They all have to hold (they are necessary), and only they have to hold (they are sufficient), in order for something to be a convention. Why does he do this? Well in part, because he thinks the criteria in 1 - 5 isolate and shed light on an interesting array of phenomena that exist among our species—driving on the right vs. left of the road (depending on where one lives), greeting people in a particular way, knocking on doors to request entry, and a zillion other things; and in part, because as a philosopher of language, he thinks one of these kinds of phenomena—linguistic conventions—is particularly interesting. Does convention, when understood as abbreviating the conditions 1 through 5, have the same meaning as the ordinary English word convention? Maybe, maybe not. It doesn’t really matter very much for our purposes, since we just want a basic way of narrowing in on the phenomenon we’re studying (language, communication, meaning, etc.), along with, perhaps, what important features it has in common with certain other practices that people engage in.\nOne of the candidate conventions we looked at was teeth-brushing. I’ll go through the criteria here to see how well they apply to this particular practice.\n\n\n\nIt’s true that not everyone conforms (or always conforms), but not conforming is often noticed or frowned upon—something which at least appears to be true of genuine conventions, in general.\nWith certain exceptions, people expect each other to conform; this case doesn’t seem out of the ordinary for established conventions.\nIt is perhaps a little bit tricky to determine whether others brushing their teeth provides a reason for one to brush one’s own teeth. On the one hand, the main reasons people brush their teeth are to help prevent cavities and to not have bad breath. On the other hand, not having bad breath—while (or because) people believe it makes interactions with other people more pleasant—is often expected. In fact, there might exist a standard in societies in which teeth-brushing is common, according to which people shouldn’t be perceived as having bad breath; further, this standard may be reinforced when people actually do brush their teeth: the more people engage in the practice, the more social pressure there is to conform. If we entertain this possibility, it appears that other people brushing their teeth can provide a reason for one to brush one’s own teeth.\nWhether or not teeth-brushing is optional or arbitrary may also seem tricky to determine. On the one hand, it might not be clear what other practice would allow people to keep their teeth clean; on the other hand, it is a bit clearer what alternative practice might allow members of a community to adhere to a communal standard: the practice of not brushing your teeth. That is, we would just have to change the standard, and suddenly, people would be relieved of the social pressure to brush one’s teeth with which it coincides.\nInsofar as the above observations are accurate, they appear to be common knowledge. Common enough, at least, that you might expect to hear a reminder if you go to the dentist.\n\nI think there’s a good argument that teeth-brushing is (sometimes) a convention: it’s a convention when the community in which it is done adopts a standard (e.g., having healthy teeth, not being perceived as having bad breath)—one that teeth-brushing helps people meet. There might, of course, be other reasons to brush your teeth than the fact that it’s a convention.",
