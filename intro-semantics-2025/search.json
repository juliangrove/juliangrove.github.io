    "text": "Bird’s-eye view\nThe goals of this course are to acquaint you with the study of meaning in natural language; specifically, to equip you with a certain vocabulary of concepts, as well as a certain collection of theoretical and methodological tools. This vocabulary and these tools will allow you to:\n\ncollect linguistic data and determine whether and how it is relevant to meaning;\nformulate and test hypotheses and theoretical claims about linguistic meaning; and\napproach questions about how linguistic meaning is situated within the broader scientific study of natural language and the human mind.\n\nThe first few weeks of the course will be more-or-less stage setting. Natural language semantics is a young field whose basic aims and guiding principles are somewhat in flux; so it will be useful to have this part of the course be dedicated to making these aims and principles fairly explicit. After these introductory weeks, we will get deep into the practice of doing semantics by focusing on a variety of empirical phenomena. The main acts will be verbs and their arguments, coordination, modification, anaphora, and quantification.",

    "section": "Assignments and grading",
    "text": "Assignments and grading\n\nGrading\nYour work in this course will consist of nine (9) short written assignments—sometimes based on assigned readings—as well as an in-person final exam. Each written assignments will be a collection of responses to questions: some of these responses will have a mini-essay format, and some will be more like answers to problem sets (it’ll be clear in any given case what the expectation is). Each assignment will be available on this site, at the end of the set of notes to which the assignment corresponds. Please turn in a physical copy of your responses at the beginning of the class on which the assignment is due.\nThe written assignments will be graded on a 5-point scale, using the following rubric:\n\n5: you thoroughly engage with each question on the assignment. This means that you justify each of your responses, as well point out its implications, if appropriate. For example, if the truth of your response is likely to have any unintuitive consequences, you should note and explain these. Doing this well will sometimes be challenging and require you to think a lot.\nIf the assignment has questions requiring the application of analytical techniques that we have introduced in the course, “thorough engagement”, for current purposes, means applying these techniques in the right way.\n4: you thoroughly engage with most, but not all, of the questions.\n3: you thoroughly engage with only a small part of the assignment and give shallow or cursory answers to most of it.\n2: you give shallow or cursory answers to all of the questions on the assignment.\n1: you barely do the assignment.\n0: you don’t even barely do the assignment.\n\nThe written assignments will account for 90% of your grade, and the final exam, for 10%. The final will take place from 10am-12pm on December 10th (place TBD). It will be formatted similarly to the assignments.\nThe following grading scale will be used to determine course grades:\n\n\n\n93.5 ≤ A ≤ 100\n89.5 ≤ A- &lt; 93.5\n\n\n\n86.5 ≤ B+ &lt; 89.5\n83.5 ≤ B &lt; 86.5\n79.5 ≤ B- &lt; 83.5\n\n\n76.5 ≤ C+ &lt; 79.5\n74.5 ≤ C &lt; 76.5\n69.5 ≤ C &lt; 74.5\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed or late work\nLate work will not be accepted unless you’ve arranged with me beforehand. If you need an extension, ask for one—just do it prior to the due date.\n\n\nExtra credit\nIf you like, you can get extra credit, accounting for up to an additional 2% of your course grade, in one of two ways:\n\nYou can earn up to two credits by participating in linguistics studies through the Linguistics Department’s SONA account (so, one percentage point of your grade per credit). This document has more information; so does this video. If you go this route, please participate in the studies before November 22.\nYou can read and summarize the main arguments of a (short) semantics paper, i.e., published in a journal, collection, or conference proceedings. I’ll provide some suggestions of papers soon, but you can also summarize one of your choosing, so long as you consult with me about it first.",
